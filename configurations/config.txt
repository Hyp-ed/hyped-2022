# configuration file, all config files should be in ./configurations/ folder
# line starting with '#' characters are ignored, i.e. comments
# lines cannot be longer than 250 characters, else the world breaks


# lines starting with '>' start a new parsing section for a new module
# e.g. "> Navigation" line indicates all following lines will be parse by
# ParseNavigation() function
# All modules are defined in src/utils/config.hpp file as part of a MODULE_LIST.
# New modules can be added by extending this list and defining the corresponding
# Parse<module_name>() function.

# now, the config files support #include statements to make the configurations more modular
# whenever config file contains line "$ <another_config_file>", the parser stops processing
# the current config file and steps into processing <another_config_file>.
# note, the currenct module is reset to "Nomodule" whenever stepping into or out of a config files
# therefore, users should always define their "> Module" at the beginning of the config file
# and after any "$ <file>" include statement
